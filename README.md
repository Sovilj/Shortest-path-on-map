# Shortest-path-on-map
Find the shortest way between two points on a map

-Accepting the path to the document which contains the map description (the map coordinates, start point and end point).
-Accept the path to the document that will contain the task solution as an input parameter.

Implemented BranchAndBound algorithm for findind shortest paths between two fields on map, reading from XML file, and writing in txt file in a specified format.

Program is run from a .jar file (search_app.jar) with 2 input parameters, absolute path to input file and absolute path to outputfile which will be created and the solution writen in it.
